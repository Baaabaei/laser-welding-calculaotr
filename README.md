this caculator allows you to calculate the laser power for different materials and processes. It also includes a table of different materials and their properties, which can be used to suggest the type and power of the laser based on the material.

Table of materials and their properties:
Material	Melting point (degrees Celsius)	Tensile strength (MPa)	Refractive index
Steel	1454	500	None
Glass	801	None	1.52
Aluminum	660	275	None
Copper	1085	325	None
Titanium	1668	885	None

Formulas to suggest the type and power of the laser:

    Welding: Use the formula for laser power for welding to calculate the required laser power. Femtosecond lasers are typically used for welding metals, while CO2 lasers are typically used for welding non-metals.
    Cutting: Use the formula for laser power for cutting to calculate the required laser power. CO2 lasers are typically used for cutting non-metals, while fiber lasers are typically used for cutting metals.

Note: These formulas are simplified and may not be accurate for all materials and laser systems. For more precise calculations, it is recommended to consult with a expert or use specialized software.
